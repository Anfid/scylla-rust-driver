Before, make sure a node is running:
$ make scylla-up

In order to run the tests inside docker container:
$ make test

After testing, stop it using:
$ make scylla-down

Additional helpful commands:
$ make scylla-logs
$ make scylla-bash
$ make scylla-cqlsh

If encountering problems with `make test`, try executing `./test_in_docker.sh` directly. On Windows, you should run `./test_in_docker.ps1` in PowerShell.

If lacking Make (especially on Windows), you can use docker-compose manually, by hand writing commands written in Makefile.
